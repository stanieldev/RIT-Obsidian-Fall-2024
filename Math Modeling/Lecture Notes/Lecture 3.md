## Interest Models

### Simple Interest
$$\begin{align}
I&=P\cdot r\cdot n & (\text{Interest})\\
T&=P\cdot(1+r\cdot n) & (\text{Total})\\
\end{align}$$
 - Principle amount $(P)$
 - Annual interest rate $(r)$
 - Term of loan $(n)$
 - Total loan payment $(T)$


### Compound Interest
$$\begin{align}
I&=P\left(1+\dfrac{r}{f}\right)^{fn} - P& (\text{Interest})\\
T&=P\left(1+\dfrac{r}{f}\right)^{fn}& (\text{Total})\\
\end{align}$$
 - Principle amount $(P)$
 - Annual interest rate $(r)$
 - Term of loan $(n)$
 - Frequency of payment $(f)$
 - Total loan payment $(T)$

### Front-Loaded Interest
In the first month, the interest accrues as expected.
Each payment pays off previous interest, then the remaining balance.
Each payment knocks off more and more, even though the cost is the same.
