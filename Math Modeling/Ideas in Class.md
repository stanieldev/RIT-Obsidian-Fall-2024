Question:
How does the error of a overfit regression happen with n degree polynomials on a subset of points compared to the true integral distribution?

What about an "entropy" of a dataset compared to the true distribution?
Less points means less accurate but more degree polynomial leads to larger variability.
The best distribution would be a function with minimum entropy (minimal information to describe the distribution).
