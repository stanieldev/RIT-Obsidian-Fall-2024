Question:
How does the error of a overfit regression happen with n degree polynomials on a subset of points compared to the true integral distribution?

What about an "entropy" of a dataset compared to the true distribution?
Less points means less accurate but more degree polynomial leads to larger variability.
The best distribution would be a function with minimum entropy (minimal information to describe the distribution).

Optimizing and the maximal limit using entropy.

e^x can be written as a taylor series

take a continuous sum instead, and they grow faster than e^x:
hyper-exponential???


$$\begin{align}
e^x&=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \dfrac{x^n}{n!}\\
f(x)&=\int_{0}^\infty \dfrac{x^t}{t!}\ dt\\
\end{align}$$
