## Introduction
*For Part 3 of this module, you will work in groups to address the questions below. After class, you will have one week to submit individual solutions to these questions via MyCourses. All submissions should be typeset (no hand-written answers), and all answers should be written as complete sentences with correct grammar. (Answers that are not complete sentences will receive a 50% deduction.)*


### Questions
*Imagine the same scenarios as in Part 2 (with Nate, Catherine, and Henry). This time, however, we will consider determining monthly payments according to the front-loaded interest model, as opposed to the simple interest model.*

1. *Fill in Table 3. The rows for “Average Annual Tuition” and “Loan Amount” should be identical to what you found in Part 2. The “Monthly Payment” row, however, should be determined according to the front-loaded interest model.*
2. *Do the same for Table 4.*

I calculated this section from scratch because I ~~got incorrect~~ used the wrong numbers on the last homework. Just to make sure, I calculated all of them from scratch (this was quick).

#### Simple Interest Model

#### Frontloading Interest Model
|                        | Nate       | Catherine  | Henry      |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Average Annual Tuition | $24,333.00 | $47,713.38 | $47,713.38 |
| Loan Amount            | $12,161.50 | $23,856.69 | $23,856.69 |
| Loan Term              | 10 years   | 10 years   | 10 years   |
| Annual Interest Rate   | 7.39%      | 4.99%      | 2.69%      |
| Monthly Payment        | $143.66    | $252.92    | $226.96    |
| Total Interest Paid    | $5,077.93  | $6,493.78  | $3,378.98  |
| Cumulative Payments    | $17,239.43 | $30,350.47 | $27,235.67

3. *In all of these cases, how does the total interest paid compare to the simple interest model you used in Part 2?*

There it is, now I see the simple interest. My bad.

In comparison, I made the following table.

|                            | Nate      | Catherine  | Henry     |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Total Simple Interest      | $8,987.34 | $11,904.49 | $6,417.45 |
| Total Frontloaded Interest | $5,077.93 | $6,493.78  | $3,378.98 |
| Simple - Frontloaded       | $3,909.41 | $5,410.71  | $3,038.47 |
The interest from Frontloading decreased the amount that the students paid in interest by a pretty significant margin. For Nate, he saved almost $4,000 and Henry about $3,000.

The same can be said for the total payment of the loan, since $T=I+P$.

4. *Suppose that Catherine has started to pay off her student loans using the monthly payments you determined in Tables 3 and 4. Now suppose that after 12 months of payments, Catherine’s rich uncle gifts her $10,000. Catherine decides that immediately after her 12th loan payment, she will use the $10,000 to make an extra payment that is applied directly to reduce the principal of the loan. From that point forward, she will continue to pay monthly payments at the same level as her first 12 payments.* 

*How much earlier than the originally planned 10 years will Catherine have her loan paid off? How much total interest will she have saved?* 

She initially spent 12 months paying **$252.92/month** (using frontloaded interest payments).
She pays off the balance (after the uncle's donation) in 53 months afterward.

Catherine, through the donation from her rich uncle, spent only **65 months** (5y, 5m) paying off her loan, instead of the 10 years originally planned.

The exact value is 64.808 months, but I rounded up to **65 months** because payments are done on a monthly basis. The final payment would only be $203.71, as opposed to the consistent payment of $252.92/month.


   
*Do you believe that Catherine would be better off financially if she had not used the $10,000 to pay down the principal, but rather that she invested it in a savings account? Explain why or why not.*

Since I cannot think of any saving account that gets anywhere close to 4.99% APY dividend, I assume paying the amount outright would be better in the long-term, financially.
