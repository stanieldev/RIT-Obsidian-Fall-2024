## Introduction
For Part 2 of this module, you will work in groups to address the questions below. After class, you will have one week to submit individual solutions to these questions via MyCourses. All submissions should be typeset (no hand-written answers), and all answers should be written as complete sentences with correct grammar. (Answers that are not complete sentences will receive a 50% deduction.)

## Interest Modeling
Imagine the following scenario. Nate attended a private four-year college between 1993-1997. Catherine is planning to enroll in a private four-year college from 2025-2029. Nate had to borrow 50% of the tuition, and Catherine will have to borrow 50% of the tuition.


1. Fill in Table 1. (A version of this table is in the supplemental spreadsheet “InterestTables.xlsx” for you to use in your typeset homework submission.) Use the data file available on MyCourses that corresponds to the article “Trends in College Pricing and Student Aid 2023” (1) to determine Nate’s tuition, and use the polynomial model you found in Part 1 to estimate Catherine’s tuition.

### Nate and Catherine
|                        | Nate     | Catherine |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Average Annual Tuition |          |           |
| Loan Amount            |          |           |
| Loan Term              | 10 years | 10 years  |
| Annual Interest Rate   | 7.39%    | 4.99%     |
| Monthly Payment        |          |           |
| Total Interest Paid    |          |           |
| Cumulative Payments    |          |           |
Table 1: The case of Nate and Catherine.


2. In referring to Nate and Catherine, who pays less in interest and by how much?


3. After repaying their loans, what are the cumulative payments of Nate and Catherine?


4. In reference to the previous question, is this result in line with or contradictory to the interest rate each borrow got? 



Now imagine the following scenario. Catherine and Henry attend a four-year private college concurrently from 2025-2029, and both borrow 50% of tuition. However, Henry receives a lower interest rate on his loan.

5. Fill in Table 2. (A version of this table is also in the supplemental spread-
sheet “InterestTables.xlsx”.)
### Catherine Henry
|                        | Catherine | Henry    |
| ---------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Average Annual Tuition |           |          |
| Loan Amount            |           |          |
| Loan Term              | 10 years  | 10 years |
| Annual Interest Rate   | 4.99%     | 2.69%    |
| Monthly Payment        |           |          |
| Total Interest Paid    |           |          |
| Cumulative Payments    |           |          |
Table 2: The case of Catherine and Henry.

6. How much does Henry save in interest compared with Catherine? 
7. Is the amount significant?
