### Information
After you have completed all three parts of Module 3, you will be required to write and submit a report on what you have found. Similar to the executive summary you wrote for Module 2, you should create and write your report in a Google Doc using your @g.rit.edu email address. You should download your finalized report in PDF format and upload to MyCourses. Your report should explicitly provide an embedded link to the original Google Doc, so that I can access the Google Doc and view the version history. While writing your report, keep the following in mind:
 - Audience: You are writing an external consultant report for the cooperative.
 - Purpose: One of your purposes will be to effectively communicate mathematical concepts and ideas to a non-technical audience. (You should assume that the reader of your report is not a mathematician.)  
### Format of Report
 - 12 pt font, Times New Roman
 - 1 inch margins, double spaced throughout
 - Begin body paragraphs with topic sentences
 - conclude in a manner that gives the reader something poignant to think about (don’t repeat the main points and avoid beginning the conclusion with “In conclusion”).  

#### Content from Part I  
Your report should include the following content that is based on the tasks you completed in Part I: 
 - Your introductory fact-finding results, impressions, and questions for the cooperative.  
 - Description of the basic profit model and explanation of different strategies the cooperative can do to increase their profit.  
 - Summary of the strategies you discussed with your group, with justification of the optimal strategy with appropriate data and metrics in your evaluation. Be sure to cite any consulted sources.
 There will be additional content that you will add to the report, based on the tasks you will complete in Part II and Part III of this module.
 
#### Content from Part II
As mentioned in Part I, after you have completed all three parts of Module 3, you will be required to write and submit a report on what you have found. In the same Google Doc you created and wrote about the tasks you performed in Part I, you should add the following content based on the tasks you have just completed in Part II:
 - Your determination of which costs were important, fixed costs, and visitor-dependent costs.
 - Description and justification of the parameters $p$, $k$, and $C$, and how you set the minimum price $p$.  
 - Evaluation of the minimum wage you would give to the families.  
 - Evaluation of the feasibility of the price for visitors. Be sure to cite any consulted sources.

#### Content from Part III
As mentioned in Parts I and II, after you have completed all three parts of Module 3, you will be required to write and submit a report on what you have found. In the same Google Doc you created and wrote about the tasks you performed in Parts I and II, you should add the following content based on the tasks you have just completed in Part III:  
 - Your choice of search term in the Google Trends with justification.
 - A graph of the interest data over the course of the year, along with your fitted function. 
 - A summary of the model-data fitting with the different function families.  
 - An in-depth explanation and justification of which function family you chose to represent the data. 
 - A graph of $I'(t)$ (can be done using Mathematica / Wolfram Alpha or other appropriate software).  
 - A non-technical explanation of the meaning of I′(t) and identification of the intervals and extreme values listed above, along with their interpretation in a non-technical context.
 - An evaluation of when the best time during the year is for the cooperative to consider online social media marketing to attract more business.
