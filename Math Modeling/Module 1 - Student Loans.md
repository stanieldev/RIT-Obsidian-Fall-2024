## Part 1: Fitting Polynomials to Tuition & Fees 

### Introduction
The problem we will study in this module is presented in Chapter 18: “Student Loans: Fulfilling the American Dream or Surviving a Financial Nightmare?” (1). 
I’ve broken this problem into three parts: 
1. Explores the use of polynomial models to fit data. 
2. Explore models of interest that we will use to construct loan payment “calculators.” 
3. Incorporate aspects of President Biden’s recent Student Loan Relief plan (3, 4) to update our predictions of the cost of college for a fictitious student. 

### Tasks
For Part 1 of this module, we will be referring to the article “Trends in College Pricing and Student Aid 2023” (2) and the corresponding data file that are both available on MyCourses.

All submissions should be typeset (no handwritten answers), and all answers should be written as complete sentences with correct grammar. 
(Answers that are not complete sentences will receive a 50% deduction.)

1. Using the data in Table CP-2 “Average Tuition and Fees and Housing and Food (Enrollment-Weighted) in Current Dollars and in 2023 Dollars, 1971-72 to 2023-24,”
	1. Create three separate graphs that show the tuition and fees for (a) private non-profit four-year colleges, (b) public four-year colleges, and (c) public two-year colleges, starting from the academic year 1973-74 as year 0, and going in five-year intervals. 
	2. Each graph should show tuition and fees in 2023 dollars, and each graph should have a title or caption, as well as labels for the horizontal and vertical axes.

**Figure B:** ![[q1_public_2.png]]
**Figure C:** ![[q1_public_4.png]]



2. For the data in each of the three graphs, fit the data to a polynomial function. Explore different degrees of polynomials, and choose the degree that you think “best” represents the data. (The degree you choose can be different for each of the three graphs.) Create three additional graphs that show the chosen polynomial models with the data. 

Based on prior experience with economics, it would be reasonable that the evolution of the cost of tuition should take the form of an exponential, similar to inflation during "normal" times.

However, I noticed that Graph A, Private Nonprofit Colleges, look to have increased their tuition closer to linear growth instead of exponential growth. Not sure why this is the case, but perhaps it has to do with how the government started subsidizing universities.

3. What is the common trend for the three graphs? 

The common trend among the types of universities/colleges listed is that the cost of attendance has been steadily increasing, mostly in a low-k exponential growth way.

4. What is the domain and range of each of your chosen polynomial models? 



5. Use your polynomial models to predict the tuition and fees for a student entering each type of institution in the academic year 2028-29. Comment on whether or not you think the predictions are reasonable.



6. List the properties of polynomial functions, and explain the advantages for using them in modeling. 



7. From the graphs you generated, explain the limitations of polynomial fitting. Specify at least three limitations and consider the values of the polynomial as time increases. 



8. When do you think that polynomial modeling works best?
