## Abstract
Binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) are a cornerstone for understanding extreme astrophysical phenomena, offering insights into nuclear microphysics, general relativity, and multi-messenger astronomy. However, high-fidelity simulations of BNSMs are computationally demanding, requiring advanced methods to resolve complex dynamics such as dense nuclear matter, tidal interactions, and gravitational wave emissions. In this paper, we explore several optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of these simulations. These include improved equation of state (EoS) calculations through optimized root-finding algorithms and EoS table compression, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for dynamic resolution adjustment, and the "table swapping" method to reduce runtime computations. Additionally, we examine parallelization strategies to optimize load balancing and data communication, further enhancing computational performance. By addressing key bottlenecks in simulation workflows, these optimizations aim to push the boundaries of BNSM modeling, enabling more detailed studies of neutron star mergers and their associated astrophysical signatures.


## Background
Binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) are a significant class of astrophysical events (CITATION), integral for advancing our understanding of fundamental physics and astrophysical processes (CITATION). These systems provide us a natural laboratory to study matter and spacetime under the most extreme conditions, where densities and temperatures of nuclear matter rival those found in stellar cores (CITATION). The dynamics of BNSMs are intricately tied to the properties of neutron-rich matter, offering a rare opportunity to probe of the equation of state (EoS) governing its behavior and properties.

Beyond their inherent physical complexity, BNSMs are central to the rapidly evolving field of multi-messenger astronomy (CITATION). The first detection of gravitational waves from a BNSM, GW170817 in October 2017 (CITATION), combined with its accompanying electromagnetic counterparts—kilonovae and short gamma-ray bursts—marked a transformative moment in astrophysics, unlocking new avenues for probing the universe.  These mergers not only illuminate the physics of compact object interactions, but also play a crucial role in explaining the cosmic origin of heavy elements formed via rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, making them cosmic factories for elements like gold and platinum (CITATION).

Despite these remarkable advances, significant challenges remain in bridging theoretical predictions with observational data (CITATION). High-fidelity simulations of BNSMs are essential for decoding signals from these events, particularly those tied to the EoS, the mass thresholds for neutron star collapse, and the mechanisms driving electromagnetic counterparts (CITATION). This study aims to enhance the performance and fidelity of BNSM simulations, addressing critical gaps in understanding the interplay between microphysical processes and their macroscopic manifestations in neutron star mergers.


## Introduction
High-fidelity simulations of binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) are indispensable for accurately modeling the complex interplay of nuclear microphysics, hydrodynamics, and general-relativistic effects. However, the computational demands of these simulations are immense due to the non-linear, multi-scale nature of BNSM dynamics. To accurately resolve the dense nuclear matter core, tidal interactions, and the emission of gravitational waves, requires substantial computational resources, often limiting achievable resolution and timescales. Advancing computational methodologies is crucial to bridging this gap and enabling more efficient and precise simulations.

One key area of optimization is improving the equation of state (EoS) calculations. Since the EoS defines the relationship between key thermodynamic quantities, such as pressure $(P)$, density $(\rho)$, and temperature $(T)$, it forms the backbone of any BNSM simulation. However, resolving these properties often involves computationally-expensive root-finding algorithms to interpolate or solve the EoS table at runtime. By implementing optimized algorithms for root-finding and EoS table compression, simulation runtimes can be reduced without compromising physical accuracy or precision. These improvements streamline the retrieval of thermodynamic data, particularly under conditions of rapidly evolving high densities and temperatures.

Another critical enhancement is adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). AMR dynamically adjusts the spatial and temporal resolution of the simulation, providing high-resolution calculations in regions of interest—such as the merging core—while coarsening less dense or dynamic regions. This method reduces computational load while maintaining precision where it matters most. By effectively allocating computational resources, AMR enables the resolution of fine-scale features, such as shock waves and fluid turbulences, which are key to capturing the dynamics of BNSMs.

Parallelization strategies, leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) architecture, are also essential for improving simulation efficiency. Existing simulations already employ significant parallelization to distribute numerically-intensive tasks, such as solving partial differential equations and performing hydrodynamic calculations, across multiple processors. However, there remains significant room for optimizing and refining these methods to further enhance performance and scalability. By streamlining load-balancing, improving data communication efficiency between processors, and fine-tuning parallel algorithms, substantial reductions in computational overhead can be achieved. These refinements would enable higher-resolution and more physically-realistic models to be executed within practical timescales, improving our ability to capture the intricate details of neutron star mergers and analyze their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals with greater precision.

Another promising optimization technique is "table swapping," in which a precomputed table replaces an existing one to streamline runtime computations. In this approach, a table that takes parameters $A$, $B$, and $C$ as inputs is replaced with a single-time precomputed table parameterized by $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, optimized for the specific needs of the simulation. This new table reduces the computational burden by minimizing the number of interpolations or root-finding steps required during runtime. By shifting part of the computational cost to the pre-simulation phase, the table swap technique can lead to significant speedups in simulations without sacrificing accuracy.

A further avenue for improvement lies in leveraging graphics processing units (GPUs) for computational acceleration. GPUs excel at parallelizing large-scale numerical computations, making them well-suited for tasks such as solving hydrodynamic equations and performing interpolation-heavy operations like those involved in EoS calculations. While the integration of GPU acceleration has the potential to significantly enhance simulation performance, this direction will not be explored in this paper. The focus will instead remain on CPU-based optimization strategies.

In this paper, we explore the different optimization methods—EoS table compression, advanced root-finding algorithms, AMR, and table swapping—for their efficacy and efficiency in enhancing the performance and fidelity of BNSM simulations. By addressing both computational bottlenecks and physical accuracy requirements, our approach aims to push the boundaries of what is computationally feasible for BNSM modeling. These advancements will, not only accelerate current research efforts but also, enable more detailed explorations of the astrophysical processes driving neutron star mergers, their gravitational wave signatures, and their electromagnetic counterparts.


## Literature Review
### History of BNSMs Simulations
The simulation of binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) is a central topic in computational astrophysics, primarily due to its importance in understanding gravitational wave emission, r-process nucleosynthesis, and neutron star physics. Early work in BNSM simulations focused on idealized models, which could only approximate the complex interactions involved in these systems (CITATION). However, recent advancements have significantly enhanced the accuracy of these simulations. Modern approaches integrate relativistic hydrodynamics, nuclear equations of state (EoS), and general relativity, while accounting for complex multi-scale phenomena such as shock formation, tidal interactions, and the behavior of matter under extreme densities and temperatures (CITATION).

A key simulation techniques had included adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), which dynamically refines the grid resolution based on the evolving features of the merger (e.g., shock waves or high-density regions). This increased computational efficiency by focusing resources on regions of interest while reducing resolution in less-dynamic parts of the system (CITATION). However, even with AMR, BNSM simulations are computationally expensive due to the large parameter space, the need for high spatial and temporal resolution, and the complexity of the nuclear EoS models.

The use of high-performance computing (HPC) has allowed these simulations to evolve, with large-scale numerical relativity codes such as the Einstein Toolkit facilitating the development of state-of-the-art general-relativistic simulations. The Einstein Toolkit provides core computational infrastructure for modeling BNSMs, supporting a wide range of astrophysical simulations, and enabling the use of supercomputing resources for large-scale, high-fidelity simulations (CITATION). These parallelization strategies have significantly improved the speed and accuracy of BNSM simulations; however, despite these advances, there are still notable limitations in computational efficiency, particularly with the handling of the EoS, interpolation routines, and root-finding algorithms.

### Advancements in HPC, Relevant to BNSM Simulations
High-performance computing plays a crucial role in accelerating BNSM simulations. Modern supercomputers, such as Frontera at the University of Texas and Frontier at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, provide the computational power necessary to run large-scale simulations of complex systems like BNSMs. Frontera’s architecture, with its 4.8 teraflops of double-precision calculation capabilities (CITATION), enables high-resolution simulations, while Frontier, with its exaflop-range capabilities (CITATION), is poised to revolutionize the scale and speed of astrophysical simulations .

Additionally, strategies leveraging multi-core CPUs and GPUs are critical to enhancing the scalability and speed of these simulations. For instance, parallel algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and performing hydrodynamic calculations have allowed for significant improvements in simulation times. While much of the focus has been on hardware infrastructure, optimizing the underlying software and computational methods remains essential to fully utilize these advances.

### The Role of the Equation of State (EOS)
The equation of state (EoS) plays a central role in simulating BNSMs, as it dictates the relationship between key thermodynamic variables (such as pressure, density, and temperature) for nuclear matter at extreme conditions (CITATION). Accurate EoS calculations are critical to modeling the dynamics of matter within neutron stars and during the merger process. However, EoS table look-ups are computationally expensive, as they often require solving for the roots of a nonlinear equation, making them a significant bottleneck in simulations. Advances in efficient root-finding algorithm compression techniques have been explored to reduce the computational burden of these EoS calculations. Nevertheless, there remains a need for more efficiency that can streamline EoS look-ups without sacrificing physical accuracy.

### Gap Analysis
While BNSM simulations have seen substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency, several key areas remain where further advancements are needed. One of the primary bottlenecks in BNSM simulations is the efficiency of EoS look-ups. Despite improvements in root-finding algorithms, the need to interpolate EoS tables during runtime continues to be a major source of computational overhead. Optimizing these algorithms, and leveraging techniques such as table swapping, could help address this limitation and significantly speed up simulations.

Another area for improvement is the optimization of parallelization strategies. Although existing simulations already utilize parallelization extensively, further refinements are possible. These include optimizing load balancing, improving data communication between processors, and fine-tuning parallel algorithms. By addressing these issues, it may be possible to reduce computational overhead and achieve higher resolution simulations with greater computational efficiency.

Additionally, while adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) has proven effective in improving computational efficiency by focusing resources on dynamic regions, further advancements in AMR algorithms could help optimize the balance between computational resource allocation and physical accuracy. Developing more adaptive and intelligent AMR strategies that respond to the evolving dynamics of the merger could enhance simulation precision without incurring additional computational costs.

Finally, while the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) for simulation holds significant promise, it remains an area of future research. While not explored in the current study, the integration of GPUs into the computational workflow could lead to further improvements in simulation speed, especially in tasks that involve heavy numerical computation or interpolation.

In summary, while significant progress has been made in simulating BNSMs, there remain crucial areas where optimization techniques can provide substantial improvements. This study aims to address these gaps, focusing on EoS optimization, root-finding algorithm enhancements, parallelization refinements, and table swapping, in order to push the boundaries of what is computationally feasible for BNSM modeling.
