## Background
Binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) are a significant class of astrophysical events (CITATION), integral for advancing our understanding of fundamental physics and astrophysical processes (CITATION). These systems provide us a natural laboratory to study matter and spacetime under the most extreme conditions, where densities and temperatures of nuclear matter rival those found in stellar cores (CITATION). The dynamics of BNSMs are intricately tied to the properties of neutron-rich matter, offering a rare opportunity to probe of the equation of state (EoS) governing its behavior and properties.

Beyond their inherent physical complexity, BNSMs are central to the rapidly evolving field of multi-messenger astronomy (CITATION). The first detection of gravitational waves from a BNSM, GW170817 in October 2017 (CITATION), combined with its accompanying electromagnetic counterparts—kilonovae and short gamma-ray bursts—marked a transformative moment in astrophysics, unlocking new avenues for probing the universe.  These mergers not only illuminate the physics of compact object interactions, but also play a crucial role in explaining the cosmic origin of heavy elements formed via rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, making them cosmic factories for elements like gold and platinum (CITATION).

Despite these remarkable advances, significant challenges remain in bridging theoretical predictions with observational data (CITATION). High-fidelity simulations of BNSMs are essential for decoding signals from these events, particularly those tied to the EoS, the mass thresholds for neutron star collapse, and the mechanisms driving electromagnetic counterparts (CITATION). This study aims to enhance the performance and fidelity of BNSM simulations, addressing critical gaps in understanding the interplay between microphysical processes and their macroscopic manifestations in neutron star mergers.


## Introduction
High-fidelity simulations of binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) are indispensable for accurately modeling the complex interplay of nuclear microphysics, hydrodynamics, and general-relativistic effects. However, the computational demands of these simulations are immense due to the non-linear, multi-scale nature of BNSM dynamics. To accurately resolve the dense nuclear matter core, tidal interactions, and the emission of gravitational waves, requires substantial computational resources, often limiting achievable resolution and timescales. Advancing computational methodologies is crucial to bridging this gap and enabling more efficient and precise simulations.

One key area of optimization is improving the equation of state (EoS) calculations. Since the EoS defines the relationship between key thermodynamic quantities, such as pressure $(P)$, density $(\rho)$, and temperature $(T)$, it forms the backbone of any BNSM simulation. However, resolving these properties often involves computationally-expensive root-finding algorithms to interpolate or solve the EoS table at runtime. By implementing optimized algorithms for root-finding and EoS table compression, simulation runtimes can be reduced without compromising physical accuracy or precision. These improvements streamline the retrieval of thermodynamic data, particularly under conditions of rapidly evolving high densities and temperatures.

Another critical enhancement is adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). AMR dynamically adjusts the spatial and temporal resolution of the simulation, providing high-resolution calculations in regions of interest—such as the merging core—while coarsening less dense or dynamic regions. This method reduces computational load while maintaining precision where it matters most. By effectively allocating computational resources, AMR enables the resolution of fine-scale features, such as shock waves and fluid turbulences, which are key to capturing the dynamics of BNSMs.

Parallelization strategies, leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) architecture, are also essential for improving simulation efficiency. Existing simulations already employ significant parallelization to distribute numerically-intensive tasks, such as solving partial differential equations and performing hydrodynamic calculations, across multiple processors. However, there remains significant room for optimizing and refining these methods to further enhance performance and scalability. By streamlining load-balancing, improving data communication efficiency between processors, and fine-tuning parallel algorithms, substantial reductions in computational overhead can be achieved. These refinements would enable higher-resolution and more physically-realistic models to be executed within practical timescales, improving our ability to capture the intricate details of neutron star mergers and analyze their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals with greater precision.

Another promising optimization technique is "table swapping," in which a precomputed table replaces an existing one to streamline runtime computations. In this approach, a table that takes parameters $A$, $B$, and $C$ as inputs is replaced with a single-time precomputed table parameterized by $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, optimized for the specific needs of the simulation. This new table reduces the computational burden by minimizing the number of interpolations or root-finding steps required during runtime. By shifting part of the computational cost to the pre-simulation phase, the table swap technique can lead to significant speedups in simulations without sacrificing accuracy.

A further avenue for improvement lies in leveraging graphics processing units (GPUs) for computational acceleration. GPUs excel at parallelizing large-scale numerical computations, making them well-suited for tasks such as solving hydrodynamic equations and performing interpolation-heavy operations like those involved in EoS calculations. While the integration of GPU acceleration has the potential to significantly enhance simulation performance, this direction will not be explored in this paper. The focus will instead remain on CPU-based optimization strategies.

In this paper, we explore the different optimization methods—EoS table compression, advanced root-finding algorithms, AMR, and table swapping—for their efficacy and efficiency in enhancing the performance and fidelity of BNSM simulations. By addressing both computational bottlenecks and physical accuracy requirements, our approach aims to push the boundaries of what is computationally feasible for BNSM modeling. These advancements will, not only accelerate current research efforts but also, enable more detailed explorations of the astrophysical processes driving neutron star mergers, their gravitational wave signatures, and their electromagnetic counterparts.
