As always, your work will be graded for clarity of explanation as much as for the “correctness” of your final answer. And as always, please include the names of those you collaborated with, as well as the total number of hours spent on this assignment. I’ve decided to treat this as a bonus assignment, both because I’m adding to it in this final week and because a couple of the concepts (specifically, intervals and world lines) are things you’ve seen before but that we skipped reviewing in class (although you can find a good review in Griffiths). That said, don’t blow this off, even if you don’t need the extra credit—one problem on your final exam will be lifted directly from this assignment.

## Question 1
Lorentz Transformation in 1D:
$$\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{c}ct'\\x'\end{array}\right]&=\gamma\left[\begin{array}{c}1&-\beta\\-\beta&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\x\end{array}\right] & \left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\x\end{array}\right]&=\gamma\left[\begin{array}{c}1&\beta\\\beta&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}ct'\\x'\end{array}\right]
\end{align}$$
### 1.A
Space probe #1 passes very close to earth at a time that both we (on earth) and the onboard computer on Probe1 decide to call $t=t'=0$ in our respective frames. The probe moves at a constant speed of $v=0.6c$ away from earth. When the clock aboard Probe1 reads $t'=60\text{s}$, it sends a light signal straight back to earth.

I made a Lorentz Transform Desmos plot to help my calculations:
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pzpmfdbeai
**Note:** Earth has $(x,t)$ coordinates, Probe1 has $(x',t')$ coordinates.
#### 1.A.I
At what time was the signal sent, according to Earth’s rest frame?
$$\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\x\end{array}\right]
&=\gamma\left[\begin{array}{c}1&\beta\\\beta&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}ct'\\x'\end{array}\right]\\
&=1.25\left[\begin{array}{c}1&0.6\\0.6&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}c\cdot60\text{s}\\0\end{array}\right]\\
&=1.25\left[\begin{array}{c}1\cdot c\cdot60\text{s}+0.6\cdot0\\0.6\cdot c\cdot60\text{s}+0\end{array}\right]\\
&=1.25\left[\begin{array}{c}c\cdot60\text{s}\\c\cdot36\text{s}\end{array}\right]\\
\left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\x\end{array}\right]&=\left[\begin{array}{c}c\cdot75\text{s}\\c\cdot45\text{s}\end{array}\right]\\
\Aboxed{\left[\begin{array}{c}t\\x\end{array}\right]&=\left[\begin{array}{c}75\text{s}\\45\text{ l.s.}\end{array}\right]}
\end{align}$$
#### 1.A.II
At what time in Earth’s rest frame do we receive the signal?
$$\begin{align}
\Delta t&=t_0+t_\text{signal}\\
&=t_0+\dfrac{\Delta x}{c}\\
&=75\text{s}+45\text{s}\\
\Aboxed{\Delta t&=120\text{s}}
\end{align}$$
#### 1.A.III
At what time in Probe1’s rest frame does the signal reach Earth?
$$\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{c}ct'\\x'\end{array}\right]
&=\gamma\left[\begin{array}{c}1&-\beta\\-\beta&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\x\end{array}\right]\\
&=1.25\left[\begin{array}{c}1&-0.6\\-0.6&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}c\cdot120\text{s}\\0\end{array}\right]\\
&=1.25c\left[\begin{array}{c}120\text{s}\\-0.6\cdot120\text{s}\end{array}\right]\\
\Aboxed{\left[\begin{array}{c}t'\\x'\end{array}\right]
&=\left[\begin{array}{c}150\text{s}\\90\text{ l.s.}\end{array}\right]\\}
\end{align}$$
### 1.B
Space probe #2 passes very close to earth at $t=1\mathrm{s}$ (Earth time), chasing Probe1. Probe2 is moving at $0.3c$ (as viewed by us). Probe2 launches a proton beam (which moves at $v=0.31c$ relative to Probe2) directed at Probe1. Does this proton beam strike Probe1? Please answer twice, once ignoring relativity theory, and then again using Einstein.
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/plagj5lrmc

The equation for the time where the proton beam collides with Probe 1 is:
$$\begin{align}
v(t_c-1\text{s})=0.6ct_c \implies \boxed{t_c=\dfrac{v\cdot1\text{s}}{v-0.6c}}
\end{align}$$
For the non-relativistic case, where $v=0.30c+0.31c=0.61c$, then:
$$\begin{align}
t_c&=\dfrac{0.61c\cdot1\text{s}}{0.61c-0.6c}=61\text{s}
\end{align}$$
As for the relativistic case, we need to find the net speed of the beam:
$$\begin{align}
v_\text{net}&=\dfrac{v_1+v_2}{1+v_1v_2}c=\dfrac{0.30+0.31}{1+0.30\cdot0.31}c=0.558c
\end{align}$$
Plugging it in, we see that:
$$\begin{align}
t_c&=\dfrac{0.558c\cdot1\text{s}}{0.558c-0.6c}<1\text{s}
\end{align}$$
Therefore, it never collides with Probe1 with special relativity's velocity addition.
In the classical velocity addition, Probe1 would have the proton beam collide with it.

## Question 2 (Unfinished)
When I was in undergrad, there was a brief fuss in the media about “faster than light neutrinos”. Let’s investigate those claims. Define the LHC lab in Switzerland to be located at $x_1=0$ in the Earth’s rest frame, and the Italian Gran Sasso neutrino detection facility to be located at $x_2 = 730\text{km}$. (Ignore any motion of the Earth in this problem.).
### 2.A
Suppose a beam of photons travels from LHC (starting at $x_1=t_1=0$) heading to Gran Sasso in a straight line (through vacuum).
#### 2.A.I
At what time $t_2$ will the photons arrive at the detector in Gran Sasso (in the Earth’s rest frame)? (Neglect general relativity)
$$\begin{align}
\Delta\tau&=\dfrac{\Delta x}{c}\\
t_2-0&=\dfrac{730\text{ km}}{3\cdot10^5\text{ km/s}}\\
\Aboxed{t_2&=2.4\bar{3}\text{ ms}}
\end{align}$$
#### 2.A.II
Consider the photon arrival time as measured in a frame that is moving past the LHC towards Gran Sasso at high speed $v$. This frame has been synchronized so $x_1'=t_1'=0$ when the photons leave LHC on their way towards Gran Sasso (i.e. the origins of the two frames ($x_1=x_1'=0$) coincide at $t_1=t_1'=0$). In the limit that $v$ approaches $c$ (from below), what happens to the photon arrival time ($t_2'$) as measured in the moving frame? Show that $t_2'$ is NEVER less than or equal to 0 in a frame that could contain a physical observer (one that is moving at less than $c$). Interpret this result in words (think about “causality”).
$$\begin{align}
ct_2'&=\gamma(v)\left(ct_2-\beta x_2\right)\\
&=\gamma(v)\left(c\dfrac{x_2}{c}-\beta x_2\right)\\
&=\gamma(v)\left(x_2-\beta x_2\right)\\
&=x_2\dfrac{1-\beta}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}\\
&=x_2\dfrac{1-\beta}{\sqrt{(1-\beta)(1+\beta)}}\\
ct_2'&=x_2\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\\
\Aboxed{t_2'&=\dfrac{x_2}{c}\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}}
\end{align}$$
Taking the bounds as the limits:
$$\begin{align}
\lim_{\beta\rightarrow1^-}\dfrac{x_2}{c}\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}<\ &t_2'<\lim_{\beta\rightarrow0}\dfrac{x_2}{c}\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\\
0<\ &t_2'<\dfrac{x_2}{c}\\
\Aboxed{0<\ &t_2'<t_2}
\end{align}$$
The time interval cannot become negative (i.e. go into the past) since all observes are constrained by the speed limit of $c$ from below. Therefore, causality is preserved for *all* frames that travel than less of the speed of light since $t_2'$ must happen after $t_1'$.

### 2.B
Now suppose that a beam of neutrinos could travel from the LHC (starting at $x_1=t_1=0$) heading to Gran Sasso in a straight line with a speed $v=c\left(1+2.5\cdot10^{-5}\right)$. You read that right, let’s suppose for the sake of argument that neutrinos somehow travel faster than $c$ by 25 ppm.
#### 2.B.I
At what time $t_2$ will these neutrinos arrive at the detector in Gran Sasso (in the Earth’s rest frame)? How much sooner do they arrive than the photons of part (a)?
$$\begin{align}
t_2&=\dfrac{\Delta x}{v}\\
&=\dfrac{730\text{ km}}{c\left(1+2.5\cdot10^{-5}\right)}\\
\Aboxed{t_2&=2.433272\text{ ms}}\\
\Aboxed{\Delta t&=60.83\text{ ns}}
\end{align}$$
#### 2.B.II
Now consider the neutrino arrival time, as measured in a frame that is moving past LHC towards Gran Sasso at high speed $v$. (But of course, not $>c$!) Again, synchronized so $x_1'=t_1'=0$ when the neutrinos leave LHC on their way towards Gran Sasso (i.e. the origins of the two frames coincide at $t_1=t_1'=0$). What speed (with respect to the earth frame) does a frame need, in order for a local observer to measure the neutrinos hitting the detector at $t_2'=0$ (i.e., at EXACTLY the same time as they left in that frame?) What is $\gamma$ for this frame? Is it physically possible to have an “observer” with such a $\gamma$?

Using our previous result for $t'$ as a function of $\beta$:
$$\begin{align}
t_2'&=\dfrac{x_2}{c}\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}
\end{align}$$
To find when $t'_2=0$, we can substitute and solve:
$$\begin{align}
0&=\dfrac{x_2}{c}\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\\
0&=\sqrt{1-\beta}\\
0&=1-\beta\\
\Aboxed{\beta&=1}
\end{align}$$
For it to appear at the same time as it was emitted, the observer must be traveling at the speed of light $c$. This would result in $|\gamma(c)|=\infty$. For an observer to travel at $c$, it must be massless.
#### 2.B.III (Incorrect)
If this frame were moving just a little FASTER than the above speed (but still less then c, always!) what would be the SIGN of $t_2'$, the time in that frame at which the neutrinos arrive? Is there any physical principle forbidding you from being an observer in this moving inertial frame? (In such an inertial frame, I claim the neutrinos are measured to arrive at the detector before they are emitted from the source. What do you think of this result?)
$$\begin{align}
...
\end{align}$$


### 2.C
Sketch the world line of a neutrino emitted from LHC and ending at Gran Sasso. On the same diagram, with a dashed line, indicate the world line of a photon making the same trip.
![[HW12_Q2C.png]]
I had to exaggerate the neutrino since the speeds were almost identical and overlapping.
#### 2.C.I (Incorrect)
Given such (claimed) data, is the space-time interval between emission and detection for individual neutrinos space-like, time-like, or light-like? 
Above, you considered a frame which flipped the time ordering. In that frame, again tell us about the character of the space-time interval (space-like, time-like, or light-like).


$$\begin{align}
t_2'&=\dfrac{x_2}{c}\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}
\end{align}$$







**Note:** For this section, I will be using $\Delta s^2=-(c\Delta t)^2+\Delta x^2$.
$$\begin{align}
\Delta s^2&=-(c\Delta t)^2+\Delta x^2\\
&=-(ct_2')^2+(ct_2)^2\\
\Aboxed{\Delta s^2&<0\ \ \ \text{(Timelike)}}
\end{align}$$
For the flipped time-ordering, we get a similar result since the time interval is squared.





#### 2.C.II (Incorrect)
Suppose, upon detection of a neutrino event at Gran Sasso, the detector sends back a light signal to LHC to indicate they “got it”. Add the world line of that return signal to your diagram. Given the claim that the neutrinos traveled faster than c, some people in the media claimed this meant we had “backwards time travel”. What do you think they mean by that? E.g,. does that mean that this “return signal” arrives before the original signal was sent? (Use your diagram to answer this question unambiguously.)

The time-travel would occur when $t_2'=-2t_2$, and so:
$$\begin{align}
t_2'&=\dfrac{x_2}{c}\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\\
-2\dfrac{x_2}{c}&=\dfrac{x_2}{c}\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\\
-2&=\sqrt{\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}\\
4&=\dfrac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}\\
\end{align}$$

## Question 3
**Griffiths Equation 12.109**
$$\begin{align}
E'_x&=E_x & E'_y&=\gamma(E_y-vB_z) & E'_z&=\gamma(E_z+vB_y)\\
B'_x&=B_x & B'_y&=\gamma(B_y+vE_z/c^2) & B'_z&=\gamma(B_z-vE_y/c^2)\\
\end{align}$$
### 3.A
Use Griffiths Equation 12.109 to show that both $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$ and $E^2-c^2B^2$ are Lorentz invariants. 
#### 3.A.I: Dot Product
$$\begin{align}
E_x'B_x'&=E_xB_x\\
E_y'B_y'&=\gamma(E_y-vB_z)\gamma(B_y+vE_z/c^2)\\
&=\gamma^2(E_yB_y-B_yB_zv+E_yE_zv/c^2-E_zB_zv^2/c^2)\\
E_z'B_z'&=\gamma(E_z+vB_y)\gamma(B_z-vE_y/c^2)\\
&=\gamma^2(E_zB_z+vB_yB_z-E_yE_zv/c^2-E_yB_yv^2/c^2)\\
\end{align}$$
Combining, we get:
$$\begin{align}
\vec{E}'\cdot\vec{B}'
&=E_x'B_x'+E_y'B_y'+E_z'B_z'\\
&=E_xB_x+\gamma^2(E_yB_y-E_zB_zv^2/c^2)+\gamma^2(E_zB_z-E_yB_yv^2/c^2)\\
&=E_xB_x+\gamma^2(E_yB_y-E_yB_yv^2/c^2)+\gamma^2(E_zB_z-E_zB_zv^2/c^2)\\
&=E_xB_x+\dfrac{1-v^2/c^2}{1-v^2/c^2}E_yB_y+\dfrac{1-v^2/c^2}{1-v^2/c^2}E_zB_z\\
&=E_xB_x+E_yB_y+E_zB_z\\
\Aboxed{\vec{E}'\cdot\vec{B}'&=\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}}
\end{align}$$
#### 3.A.II: Magnitudes
$$\begin{align}
(E')^2&=(E_x')^2+(E_y')^2+(E_z')^2\\
&=(E_x)^2+(\gamma(E_y-vB_z))^2+(\gamma(E_z+vB_y))^2\\
&=E_x^2+\gamma^2(E_y-vB_z)^2+\gamma^2(E_z+vB_y)^2\\
&=E_x^2+\gamma^2(E_y^2-2vE_yB_z+v^2B_z^2)+\gamma^2(E_z^2+2vE_zB_y+v^2B_y^2)\\
\\
c^2(B')^2&=c^2(B_x')^2+c^2(B_y')^2+c^2(B_z')^2\\
&=c^2B_x^2+c^2(\gamma(B_y+vE_z/c^2))^2+c^2(\gamma(B_z-vE_y/c^2))^2\\
&=c^2B_x^2+c^2\gamma^2(B_y+vE_z/c^2)^2+c^2\gamma^2(B_z-vE_y/c^2)^2\\
&=c^2B_x^2+\gamma^2(c^2B_y^2+2vE_zB_y+v^2E_z^2/c^2)+\gamma^2(c^2B_z^2-2vE_yB_z+v^2E_y^2/c^2)\\
\end{align}$$
Combining, we get:
$$\begin{align}
(E')^2-c^2(B')^2&=E_x^2+\gamma^2(E_y^2-2vE_yB_z+v^2B_z^2)+\gamma^2(E_z^2+2vE_zB_y+v^2B_y^2)\\
&-c^2B_x^2-\gamma^2(c^2B_y^2+2vE_zB_y+v^2E_z^2/c^2)-\gamma^2(c^2B_z^2-2vE_yB_z+v^2E_y^2/c^2)\\
&=E_x^2-c^2B_x^2+\gamma^2(-2vE_yB_z+2vE_zB_y-2vE_zB_y+2vE_yB_z)\\
&+\gamma^2(E_y^2-E_y^2v^2/c^2)-c^2\gamma^2(B_y^2-B_y^2v^2/c^2)\\
&+\gamma^2(E_z^2-E_z^2v^2/c^2)-c^2\gamma^2(B_z^2-B_z^2v^2/c^2)\\
&=E_x^2-c^2B_x^2+E_y^2-c^2B_y+E_z^2-c^2B_z\\
&=E_x^2+E_y^2+E_z^2-c^2(B_x^2+B_y^2+B_z^2)\\
\Aboxed{(E')^2-c^2(B')^2&=E^2-c^2B^2}
\end{align}$$
#### 3.A.III
We found earlier this semester that $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are perpendicular for traveling EM waves. Given that this is true in some frame, *can there by any other reference frame in which you would find $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ not perpendicular for a traveling EM wave?*

According to the dot product, the answer is no. If they are perpendicular in one inertial frame, they must be perpendicular in all inertial frames.

### 3.B
Use your results from part (a) to answer the following questions:
#### 3.B.I
Suppose $E>cB$ in some frame. Show that there is no possible frame in which $E=0$.

If $E>cB$, then $(E')^2-c^2(B')^2>0$. Suppose $E=0$, then:
$$\begin{align}
(E')^2>c^2(B')^2\implies0>c^2(B')^2\implies0>(B')^2
\end{align}$$
Since $B'$ is a real value, this equation makes a contradiction.
Therefore, there cannot be a frame where $E=0$.
#### 3.B.II
If $E=0$ in some frame, do these relations mean that $E=0$ in every other inertial frame?
$$-c^2B^2=(E')^2-c^2(B')^2$$
The electric field can only be $E=0$ in other inertial frames iff $|B|=|B'|$, otherwise there would have to be an E-field in that frame.

#### 3.B.III
If $B=0$ (but $E$ is nonzero) in some frame, can you always (ever?) find another frame in which $E=0$ but $B$ is nonzero?
$$\begin{align}
E^2-c^2B^2&=(E')^2-c^2(B')^2\\
0^2-c^2B^2=&(E')^2-c^2(0)^2\\
-c^2B^2&=(E')^2\\
\end{align}$$
Is it not possible to transform a pure $E$-field into a pure $B$-field, since both fields are real-valued and the relationship requires one of the squares to be negative.

---
## Question 4
It’s common in nuclear and particle physics to talk about the “rapidity” of a particle, defined as $y=\cosh^{-1}\gamma$ (where $\gamma$ is the usual relativistic gamma factor, and that’s an inverse hyperbolic cosine).
### 4.A
Prove that the usual relativistic $\beta$ (that’s $\beta=v/c$) is given by $\beta=\tanh y$, then show that $\beta\gamma=\sinh y$.

This can be thought of a hyperbolic "triangle" similar to typical triangles:
$$\begin{align}
\cosh y&=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1^2-\beta^2}}
\end{align}$$
Where it takes a similar form of adjacent over hypotenuse, and so:
$$\begin{align}
\sinh y&=\dfrac{\beta}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}\\
\tanh y&=\dfrac{\beta}{1}\\
\end{align}$$
To find what we're looking for, we can simplify as:
$$\begin{align}
\Aboxed{\beta&=\tanh y}\\
\beta\gamma&=\tanh y\cosh y\\
&=\dfrac{\sinh y}{\cosh y}\cosh y\\
\Aboxed{\beta\gamma&=\sinh y}
\end{align}$$
### 4.B
Rewrite the Lorentz transformations in matrix form (i.e. Griffiths Equation 12.24) entirely in terms of the rapidity angle. The result should remind you of a different kind of transformation— please comment (for a hint, look back at Griffiths section 1.1.5).
$$\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{c}ct'\\x'\\y'\\z'\end{array}\right]&=
\left[\begin{array}{c}\gamma&-\gamma\beta&0&0\\-\gamma\beta&\gamma&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\x\\y\\z\end{array}\right]\\
&=\left[\begin{array}{c}\cosh y&-\sinh y&0&0\\-\sinh y&\cosh y&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\x\\y\\z\end{array}\right]\\
\end{align}$$
### 4.C
Suppose that observer B has rapidity $y_1$ as measured by observer A, and C has rapidity $y_2$ as measured by B. Both velocities are on the $x$-axis. Show that the rapidity of C as measured by A is just $y_1+y_2$, i.e. rapidities “add,” unlike velocities which do not simply add in relativity.
$$\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{c}ct'\\x'\\y'\\z'\end{array}\right]
&=\left[\begin{array}{c}\cosh y_1&-\sinh y_1&0&0\\-\sinh y_1&\cosh y_1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}\cosh y_2&-\sinh y_2&0&0\\-\sinh y_2&\cosh y_2&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\x\\y\\z\end{array}\right]\\
&=\left[\begin{array}{c}\cosh y_1\cosh y_2+\sinh y_1\sinh y_2&-\cosh y_1\sinh y_2-\sinh y_1\cosh y_2&0&0\\-\sinh y_1\cosh y_2-\cosh y_1\sinh y_2&\sinh y_1\sinh y_2+\cosh y_1\cosh y_2&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\x\\y\\z\end{array}\right]\\
&=\left[\begin{array}{c}\cosh(y_1+y_2)&-\sinh(y_1+y_2)&0&0\\-\sinh(y_1+y_2)&\cosh(y_1+y_2)&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\x\\y\\z\end{array}\right]\\
\end{align}$$
Under hyperbolic trigonometry rules, we can see that rapidities add like velocities do in classical mechanics.

## Question 5
You are sitting in frame $S$, watching a long uniform line of charge (the $z$-axis) move by in the $+z$ direction with constant speed $v$. In this frame $S$, the charge density is $\lambda$ $(\text{C/m})$.
### 5.A
Use Gauss’s and Ampère’s Laws to find the electric and magnetic fields in this frame. Note that the current is simply $I=\lambda v$. While you'll likely prefer cylindrical coordinates for deriving the fields, you should write your final answer in Cartesian this time.

**Electric Field**
$$\begin{align}
\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}&=\dfrac{q_\text{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\\
E\cdot2\pi sl&=\dfrac{\lambda l}{\epsilon_0}\\
E&=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0 s}\\
\vec{E}&=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0 s}\hat{s}\\
&=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0 \sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\left(\hat{x}\cos\phi+\hat{y}\sin\phi\right)\\
&=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\left(\hat{x}\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}+\hat{y}\dfrac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\right)\\
\Aboxed{\vec{E}(x,y,z)&=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0 (x^2+y^2)}\left(x\hat{x}+y\hat{y}\right)}
\end{align}$$
**Magnetic Field**
$$\begin{align}
\oint\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l}&=\mu_0I_\text{enc}\\
B\cdot 2\pi s&=\mu_0\lambda v\\
B&=\dfrac{\mu_0\lambda v}{2\pi s}\\
\vec{B}&=\dfrac{\mu_0\lambda v}{2\pi s}\hat{\phi}\\
&=\dfrac{\mu_0\lambda v}{2\pi\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\left(-\hat{x}\sin\phi+\hat{y}\cos\phi\right)\\
&=\dfrac{\mu_0\lambda v}{2\pi\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\left(-\hat{x}\dfrac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}+\hat{y}\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}\right)\\
\Aboxed{\vec{B}(x,y,z)&=\dfrac{\mu_0\lambda v}{2\pi(x^2+y^2)}\left(x\hat{y}-y\hat{x}\right)}
\end{align}$$
### 5.B
Now, let’s rederive this in a slightly convoluted but informative way. Move to a frame $S'$ moving along with the charges. In this frame, there is no current, and thus no magnetic field. Compute the pure electric field $\vec{E}'$ in this frame, expressed entirely in terms of primed coordinates. (Note that the charge density isn’t $\lambda$ in this frame—what is it instead?)
$$\begin{align}
\oint\vec{E}'\cdot d\vec{A}&=\dfrac{q_\text{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\\
E'\cdot2\pi sl'&=\dfrac{\lambda' l'}{\epsilon_0}\\

### 5.C
Find both $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ in the $S$ frame, even though you started with just pure electric $\vec{E}'$ in frame $S'$. Don’t forget to rewrite any and all primed variables back in terms of the unprimed coordinate system (that requires Lorentz transformations too, and don’t forget, in the $z$ direction, not the usual $x$ direction). If you pull it off correctly, you should recover the same $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ you got in part a. (Let’s take a moment to appreciate what just happened here. Starting from a pure electric field in one frame, you were able to find the magnetic field in another reference frame via Lorentz boosts. In this way, a person could find that magnetic field without knowing a thing about Ampère’s Law! This is an essential unification of electromagnetism!)

**Equation 12.109 in Griffiths**
$$\begin{align}
E'_x&=E_x & E'_y&=\gamma(E_y-vB_y) & E'_z&=\gamma(E_z+vB_z)\\
B'_x&=B_x & B'_y&=\gamma(B_y+v/c^2E_z) & B'_z&=\gamma(B_z-v/c^2E_y)\\
\end{align}$$
Big guess but I'm using the cycling behavior to conjecture:
$$\begin{align}
E'_z&=E_z & E'_x&=\gamma(E_x-vB_x) & E'_y&=\gamma(E_y+vB_y)\\
B'_z&=B_z & B'_x&=\gamma(B_x+v/c^2E_y) & B'_y&=\gamma(B_y-v/c^2E_x)\\
\end{align}$$
We actually want to look at the opposite transform, however, since this is the forward transform, and so we'll need:
$$\begin{align}
E_z&=E_z' & E_x&=\gamma(E_x'+vB_x') & E_y&=\gamma(E_y'-vB_y')\\
B_z&=B_z' & B_x&=\gamma(B_x'-v/c^2E_y') & B_y&=\gamma(B_y'+v/c^2E_x')\\
\end{align}$$
Since there's only electric field components, we can simplify the above as:
$$\begin{align}
E_z&=E_z' & E_x&=\gamma E_x & E_y&=\gamma E_y'\\
B_z&=0 & B_x&=-\dfrac{\gamma v}{c^2}E_y' & B_y&=\dfrac{\gamma v}{c^2}E_x'\\
\end{align}$$
Substituting our answer from previous, we get:
$$\begin{align}
E_z&=E_z' & E_x&=\gamma\dfrac{\lambda/\gamma}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2} & E_y&=\gamma \dfrac{\lambda/\gamma}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{y}{x^2+y^2}\\
B_z&=0 & B_x&=-\dfrac{\gamma v}{c^2}\dfrac{\lambda/\gamma}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{y}{x^2+y^2} & B_y&=\dfrac{\gamma v}{c^2}\dfrac{\lambda/\gamma}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2}\\\\

E_z&=E_z' & E_x&=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2} & E_y&=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{y}{x^2+y^2}\\
B_z&=0 & B_x&=-\dfrac{\mu_0\epsilon_0}{\epsilon_0}\dfrac{\lambda v}{2\pi}\dfrac{y}{x^2+y^2} & B_y&=\dfrac{\mu_0\epsilon_0}{\epsilon_0}\dfrac{\lambda v}{2\pi}\dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2}\\\\

E_z&=E_z' & E_x&=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2} & E_y&=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{y}{x^2+y^2}\\
B_z&=0 & B_x&=-\dfrac{\mu_0\lambda v}{2\pi}\dfrac{y}{x^2+y^2} & B_y&=\dfrac{\mu_0\lambda v}{2\pi}\dfrac{x}{x^2+y^2}
\end{align}$$
Rewriting in vector notation, we see that:
$$\begin{align}
\vec{E}&=\dfrac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0}\dfrac{1}{x^2+y^2}\left(x\hat{x}+y\hat{y}\right)\\
\vec{B}&=\dfrac{\mu_0\lambda v}{2\pi}\dfrac{1}{x^2+y^2}\left(x\hat{y}-y\hat{x}\right)
\end{align}$$
This is, indeed, the same as expected from the moving frame of reference.

## Question 6
### 6.A
A conserved quantity is the same *over time*.
An invariant quantity is the same *under a coordinate transform*.
### 6.B
Can you have a conserved thing that is not invariant?
*Velocity of the Center of Mass, Energy, Momentum.*

How about the other way around?
*Spacetime Intervals, Proper Time.*

Can you have something that is both? Neither? Briefly, explain/comment.
*Electric Charge, Rest Mass (4-Momentum)*
There probably are others, but none I can think of at the moment.
### 6.C
Suppose you have measured many processes involving particles with some initial momentum and energy, and some final momentum and energy. You find that the final and initial energies and momenta are related in that they are CONSERVED. Show that energy and momentum (use the relativistic versions) are conserved in ALL inertial frames if they are conserved in ONE inertial frame.

Any state represented by frame $S$ will have an invariant inertial rest mass by:
$$P\cdot P=p_\nu p^\nu=g_{\mu\nu}p^\mu p^\nu=-(mc^2)^2$$
Since 4-momentum is invariant under Lorentz transforms, and the norm is frame-independent, then Energy-Momentum is conserved in all inertial frames.

To make it more solid, with individual conservations, we can write relativistic corrections for energy and momentum as:
$$\begin{align}
E&=\gamma mc^2\\
\vec{p}&=\gamma m\vec{v}
\end{align}$$
Both of these are Lorentz invariant, since they account for the velocities in terms of the gamma factor between all differing frames. 

### 6.D
Can relativistic momentum be conserved in all reference frames without conservation of relativistic energy?
$$\vec{p}=m\dfrac{d\vec{x}}{dt}=m\dfrac{d\vec{x}}{d\tau}\dfrac{d\tau}{dt}=\gamma m\vec{v}$$
So long as there are no forces involved, the conservation of momentum is conserved.
This is because any change in momenta must be the same in all inertial reference frames, and so long as the acceleration is zero then momentum is conserved.
