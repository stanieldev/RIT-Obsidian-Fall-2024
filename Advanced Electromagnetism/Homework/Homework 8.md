## Question 1
Consider a 3D electromagnetic plane wave in vacuum, described in complex form by $\vec{E}(\vec{r},t)=\vec{E}_0e^{i\left(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}-\omega t\right)}$, where $\vec{E_0}=E_0\hat{y}$, with $\vec{E_0}=|E_0|e^{i\pi/2}$. $\vec{k}$ is the wave vector $k\hat{x}$ and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. As usual, the true field is $\vec{E}_r=\Re\left(\vec{E}\right)$.
### 1.A
#### 1.A.I
*Which direction is the wave moving in, and in what direction does the electric field point?*
$$\begin{align}
\text{Wave Propagation} : \hat{x}\\
\text{Electric Field} : \hat{y}\\
\end{align}$$
#### 1.A.II
*What is the speed, wavelength, and period of the wave?*
$$\begin{align}
T&=\dfrac{2\pi}{\omega}\\
\lambda&=\dfrac{2\pi}{k}\\
c&=\dfrac{\omega}{k}
\end{align}$$
#### 1.A.III
*What does the phase of $\pi/2$ in $\vec{E_0}$ do?*
The phase of $\pi/2$ moves the electric wave back by a quarter of a wavelength, shown as a phase offset.
#### 1.A.IV
Sketch the true field $\vec{E}_r(x,0,0,0)$ (a 2D plot with x on the horizontal axis) and $\vec{E}_r(0,0,0,t)$ (a 2d plot with t on the horizontal axis). Clearly indicate the direction of the field and the scale of both your axes. *How is the field at $(0,a,0)$ different from the field at $y=0$*?

**Figure 1:** Plot of $\vec{E}_r(x,0,0,0)$, scaled by $1/k$ on the $x$-axis, and scaled by $1/|E_0|$ on the $y$-axis.

**Figure 2:** Plot of $\vec{E}_r(0,0,0,t)$, scaled by $1/\omega$ on the $x$-axis, and scaled by $1/|E_0|$ on the $y$-axis.

The field at $(0,a,0)$ is identical to the field at $y=0$, since there is no $y$-component.
### 1.B
*Describe in words what this mathematical expression represents physically. Why is this called a plane wave (where is/are the planes)?*

The plane wave is a 2D cross-section of space whose normal is in the direction of propagation and the plane spanned by the cross product of $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$. Alternatively, the "plane" of the plane wave is the plane of the direction that the Electric field is independent of, and so the $y$ and $z$ axes.

*Sketch or represent this in 3d. Describe how the direction of the electric field changes in time. If $\vec{E}$ always points along the same axis, the wave is said to be linearly polarized. Is this wave linearly polarized?*

**Figure 3:** Plot of the plane wave, the span of $\vec{E}$, scaled by $1/k$ on the $x$-axis.

The wave is linearly polarized since the plane wave never changes direction. It always travels in the $x$ direction found in the $\vec{k}$.
### 1.C
Find the associated magnetic field $\vec{B}(\vec{r},t)$ for this plane wave. Sketch the magnetic fields $\vec{B}(x,0,0,0)$ and $\vec{B}(0,0,0,t)$ (as above, be clear about your axes. *Describe in words how $B$ compares/contrasts with $E$.*
![[HW8_1C_1.png]]
**Figure 4:** Plot of $\vec{B}_r(x,0,0,0)$, scaled by $1/k$ on the $x$-axis, and scaled by $1/|B_0|$ on the $y$-axis.

![[HW8_1C_2.png]]
**Figure 5:** Plot of $\vec{B}_r(0,0,0,t)$, scaled by $1/\omega$ on the $x$-axis, and scaled by $1/|B_0|$ on the $y$-axis.

The time-dependence is identical, since they are in-phase orthogonal waves.
The $x$ component of $\vec{B}$ is $0$, since $\vec{B}$ points in the $\hat{z}$ direction.
