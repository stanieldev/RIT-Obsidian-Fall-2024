## Question 1
Consider an infinitely tall solenoid (radius $R$, $n$ coils per unit length), wrapped around it is a single loop of wire (radius $r$, centered at the left edge of the solenoid, shown).
### 1.a
*What Calculate the mutual inductance $M$ between the loop and the solenoid. Would this value be bigger, smaller, or the same if $r$ were twice as big?*
$$\begin{align}
...
\end{align}$$
### 1.b
*Suppose now that the loop is doubled up (but still with the same radius) so that it wraps around the solenoid twice. Again, calculate the mutual inductance of the loop-solenoid system.*
$$\begin{align}
...
\end{align}$$
### 1.c
*If the solenoid were of finite length instead, would the mutual inductance between the loop and the solenoid be larger, smaller, or the same size as in part a? Briefly explain your answer.*
**Note:** You don’t need to calculate $M$ here; a qualitative argument will be sufficient.
$$\begin{align}
...
\end{align}$$
### 1.d
*Calculate the self-inductance per unit length of the infinite solenoid, all by itself, then*
*explicitly check that the units of your answer work out correctly.*
$$\begin{align}
...
\end{align}$$

## Question 2
Two circular loops of wire are arranged so that they lie in the same plane and are concentric. One loop, of radius $a$, is TINY, much smaller than the other, which has radius $b$, i.e. $a\ll b$.  *If the small loop is driven with a time varying current $I_a(t)$, derive an approximate formula for the induced emf in the large loop (and please state the approximations or assumptions you make in your derivation).*
$$\begin{align}
...
\end{align}$$

## Question 3
Consider a coaxial cable consisting of an (infinitely) long wire of radius $a$, with given current flowing uniformly up it (so that $\vec J(t)=I(t)/(\pi a^2)\hat{k}$ goes uniformly through the wire). At the outside edge ($s=a$), there is an infinitesimally thin insulator, and just outside that, an infinitesimally thin sheath that returns ALL the current, basically a surface current going down the opposite direction carrying a total $-I(t)$ back down the length of the wire.
### 3.a
*Find the magnetic field vector (magnitude and direction) everywhere in space.*
**Note:** Assume that $I(t)$ varies slowly enough that quasi-static methods are appropriate.
$$\begin{align}
...
\end{align}$$
### 3.b
*Find the self-inductance per unit length of this cable.*

**Hint:** You might start from $\Phi_B=IL$, but this turns out to be tricky here, since the
current is not confined to a single path. It’s easier to instead think about the total
magnetic energy, $W$, stored by the magnetic field, and use our usual relation between
energy and current: $W=\tfrac{1}{2}LI^2$

**Something else to think about:** You found $L$ per unit length of a solenoid in question 1.
You now know that the wire making up the solenoid also has its own contribution to the
inductance. Which contribution will dominate when considering a real solenoid made up
of real wire?
$$\begin{align}
...
\end{align}$$

## Question 4
Consider the electrical circuit shown to the right. There is an infinitely long solenoid in the center of the wires (shaded, shown end-on in the figure). The current in that solenoid circulates clockwise and increases linearly with time, producing a flux (into the page) that is likewise linear in time: $\Phi_B=\alpha t$. Surrounding that solenoid are some ideal wires and two resistors, as shown, with ideal voltmeters (that means they have very high internal resistance, and thus negligible current flows through them) connected as shown (the probes of voltmeter $V_1$ are directly across resistor $R_1$, and those of $V_2$ are across $R_2$).
### 4.a
What do the two voltmeters read? Make sure to include the signs. If the two readings are
different, how can that be? Is it the case that points $a$ and $b$ should have a unique voltage
drop between them, and if not, why not?
$$\begin{align}
...
\end{align}$$
### 4.b
Now consider two of those circuits connected as shown in the figure below.
The solenoids are identical, both with the same cross-sectional area ($=0.2m^2$), and the
magnitude of the magnetic field inside both is equal and increasing at the same constant
rate ($0.02\ \mathrm{T/s}$), though note the direction of the current is opposite in the two solenoids,
so the B-fields are in fact increasing in opposite directions. The resistors have the values
shown.
Determine the current (magnitude and direction) passing through each resistor.
$$\begin{align}
...
\end{align}$$
