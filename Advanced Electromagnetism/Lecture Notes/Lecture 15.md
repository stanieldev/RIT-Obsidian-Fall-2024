### Conserved Momentum
Last time, we showed that the electromagnetic field can store momentum in order to make sure momentum is conserved in all inertial frames.

In terms of tensors and momentum flux:
$$\begin{align}
\oint T\cdot d\vec{A}&=\dfrac{\partial\mathbb{\vec P}}{\partial t}+\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}\int\epsilon_0\mu_0\vec{S}\ d\tau\\
\end{align}$$
