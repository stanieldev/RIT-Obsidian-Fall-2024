### Invariance
We saw on our worksheet that what looks like a magnetic force in one inertial frame is perceived as an electric force in another. Fields $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ differed in the two frames as well. We now want to consider how quantities transform under Lorentz boosts.
### Lorentz Invariance
A vector in terms of spacetime is called a $4$-vector (rank 1 tensor).
Electromagnetism doesn't transform like this, they're require a rank 2 tensor called a bivector/bilinear form {(0,2) or (2,0) tensors}.
$$\eta=[-,+]$$
Using this convention for the rest of the class.
### 4-Vectors
Some example of 4-vectors are:
$$\begin{align}
X&=\left[\begin{array}{c}ct\\\vec{x}\end{array}\right] & \text{(4-position)}\\
P&=\left[\begin{array}{c}E/c\\\vec{p}\end{array}\right] & \text{(4-momentum)}\\
\end{align}$$
And their norms are:
$$\begin{align}
X^\dagger X&=X_\mu X^\nu e^\mu e_\nu=(ct)^2-x^2-y^2-z^2\\
P^\dagger P&=P_\mu P^\nu e^\mu e_\nu=E^2-c^2|\vec{p}|^2=(mc^2)^2\\
\end{align}$$

### Electromagnetic Charge
Charge is invariant and conserved in all inertial frames of reference.
